**LeetCode Problem** : <https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=array>

### Description

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Example

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Here's a C solution to find two numbers in an array that add up to a target value, along with an explanation of how it works:

### Solution Code
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int* twoSum(int* nums, int numsSize, int target, int* returnSize) {
    *returnSize = 2;
    int* result = (int*)malloc(2 * sizeof(int));

    for (int i = 0; i < numsSize; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numsSize; j++) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                result[0] = i;
                result[1] = j;
                return result;
            }
        }
    }

    // This line is theoretically unreachable due to problem constraints
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int nums[] = {2, 7, 11, 15};
    int target = 9;
    int returnSize;

    int* result = twoSum(nums, sizeof(nums)/sizeof(nums[0]), target, &returnSize);

    printf("Indices: [%d, %d]\n", result[0], result[1]);
    free(result);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Function Parameters**:
   - `nums`: The input array of integers
   - `numsSize`: The number of elements in the array
   - `target`: The target sum we're trying to achieve
   - `returnSize`: Pointer to store the size of the returned array (always 2 for this problem)

2. **Nested Loop Approach**:
   - Outer loop (`i`) goes through each element
   - Inner loop (`j`) checks all subsequent elements
   - Checks if `nums[i] + nums[j] == target`

3. **Return Handling**:
   - When a pair is found, stores their indices in a dynamically allocated array
   - Returns the array immediately (problem states exactly one solution exists)

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Allocates memory for the result array
   - Caller must free this memory (done in `main()` here)

### Example Walkthrough

For input `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]` and `target = 9`:
1. First iteration (i=0, j=1): 2 + 7 = 9 → match found
2. Returns indices [0, 1]

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) - Nested loops checking all possible pairs
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant space aside from the returned array

### Alternative Approaches

For better time efficiency (O(n)) at the cost of space (O(n)), you could use a hash table to store seen values and their indices, checking for complements as you iterate. However, the above solution is simpler to implement in C.

### Edge Cases Handled

- The solution works for:
  - Positive and negative numbers
  - Zero in the input array
  - Target sums that require negative numbers
- The problem guarantees exactly one solution exists, so no need for additional checks

This is a straightforward implementation that satisfies all the problem requirements while being easy to understand.
