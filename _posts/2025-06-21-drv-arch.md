## Driver Architecture

Devices which are directly memory mapped, gather the register and operation details from datasheet
and based on those details build the driver and deploy in kernel space and make it avaiable as
a service to user space.

This below diagram shows the heirarcy of how slave are connected in the system on the peripheral because
of which each slave doesn't require a dedicated address space and hence can be managed as periheral
devices on peripheral bus. 

Slaves are managed by device controller because it is not memory mapped, but it is hosted on peripheral
bus and that bus can be of I²C/SPI or USB etc, and that device controller or host controller 
knows the presence of slave and can managed these slaves, CPU doesn't know the presence of slaves directly.

               └───────────┘
```

Device Controller means set of circuits design to implement a parictular device functionality
When device controller is put as master to host a peripheral bus then such an IP is called bus controller
to support various slaves. Example:  USB, PCIe and SPI etc are bus controller.

Hence as per protocol relayed by bus, host controller will communicate to the slave not the CPU.

### **Common Types of Peripheral Buses**

| **Bus Type** | **Usage**                          | **Example Devices**               |
|--------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **USB**      | General-purpose peripherals        | Keyboards, flash drives, webcams  |
| **PCIe**     | High-speed expansion cards         | GPUs, SSDs, network cards         |
| **SATA**     | Storage devices                    | HDDs, SSDs                        |
| **I²C/SPI**  | Low-speed embedded systems         | Sensors, microcontrollers         |

### **How It Works**

In above architecture:

- The **peripheral bus** is the link between **Device Controllers** (e.g., USB Controller, SATA Controller) and **Slaves** (actual devices).
- Example:
  - A **USB bus** connects a **USB controller** to a printer (Slave 1) and mouse (Slave 2).
  - A **SATA bus** links a **storage controller** to an SSD (RAM 2’s path).

---

### **Why It Matters**
- **Without a bus**, each device would need a dedicated connection to the CPU (impractical and costly).
- **Enables scalability**: Add/remove devices without redesigning the entire system.
- **Standardizes communication**: Ensures compatibility across manufacturers.
